## Convert Evernote Notebook to Markdown

Evernote uses it's own file type, ENEX (Evernote Export). I want to convert it to Markdown and transfer my old notes to Obsidian which is the app I have been using recently for note taking.
Evernote has become bloated with subscriptions and I am no longer able to use its free tier due to the number of notes I have saved over the years.

Since I am currenty upskilling in JavaScript, I've decided to create this application to help me learn and streamline the process of backing up my notes.
